![Awesome Developer Marketing](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BigFoolishGull-size_restricted.gif)

A living document of (sometimes pretty unstructured and often off-on-a-tangent) hand-picked resources for marketers who're marketing to developers (B2D). I also have another list of [awesome-marketing](https://github.com/ronakganatra/awesome-marketing) resources.

If you're in B2D or actively marketing to developers and want to join a likeminded group of people, check out the [Developer Marketing Community](https://marketingto.dev/) I'm co-building.

I'm also co-building [Savepad](https://savepad.app) - a collaborative swipe file SaaS for cross-functional growth/marketing teams. Savepad is your little corner on the internet to store, organize, reference, and share all the amazing inspiration, resources, and examples you find online. Join the waitlist üëá

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ronakganatra/ronakganatra/master/Waitlist%20Banner.png">](https://savepad.app)

If you found this list helpful, tweet it to let other dev marketers find it!
