# awesome-developer-marketing

A living document of (sometimes pretty unstructured and often off-on-a-tangent) hand-picked resources for marketers who're marketing to developers (B2D).

🚧 Very much still a work in progress 🚧

I also have another list of [awesome-marketing](https://github.com/ronakganatra/awesome-marketing) resources.

Ever since joining [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com) I've been on a steep learning curve - figuring out how different B2D is compared to B2C/B2B. I've grown to love the developer mindset of rewarding helpful content, avoiding shady gated practices, and building engaging communities - and I've tried to catalog my resources to help others out as well.

Want to contribute to grow/improve this? PRs welcome!
